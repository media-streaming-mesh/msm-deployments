### MSM Kubernetes Deployments Using Helm Charts

***

This repository contains deployment scripts and configurations for the Media Streaming Mesh (MSM) project.

MSM is an open-source framework that enables real-time media applications to be first-class citizens in cloud-native Kubernetes environments.

MSM facilitates real-time audio and video streaming over the Internet using a distributed mesh network, is designed to be resilient to network disruptions, and is capable of delivering high-quality media streams with low latency.

The deployments in this repository are designed to help users quickly set up and run an MSM deployment.

## **Contents**

This repository contains several directories, each of which represents a different deployment scenario:

`msm`: Contains templates and values for deploying the MSM infrastructure using Helm Charts.

`camera`: Contains templates and values for deploying Live Camera Feeds on MSM using Helm Charts.

`rtsp`: Contains templates and values for deploying an RTSP Server on MSM using Helm Charts.

Each deployment scenario has its own README file with instructions on how to set up and run the deployment.
